# Refactor-VBA

Overview of Project: At the click of a button Steve can analyze 2017 and 2018 stocks performance for his parents.

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Summary: Advantage of refactoring code is to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information.  Refactoring code can successfully make the VBA script run faster.
Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality, you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.
